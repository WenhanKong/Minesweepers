Welcome to the world of minesweepers! We are a group of ambitious students from UC Irvine trying to implement one of the most classic computer games, in MineCraft. Using Microsoft's [Malmo](https://github.com/microsoft/malmo) package, we're able to implement Minesweeper in Minecraft, using algorithms descried in [final.md](https://github.com/WenhanKong/Minesweepers/blob/master/docs/final.md). The following articles/websited have offered us tremendous help during our project's making process:

- [Minesweeper Wiki](http://www.minesweeper.info/wiki/)
- [How to Beat Minesweeper](https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-beat-Minesweeper/)
- [Solving Minesweeper](https://magnushoff.com/minesweeper/)
- [How cellular automaton plays Minesweeper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0096300396001178?via%3Dihub)
- [Infinite versions of minesweeper are Turing complete](http://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/R.W.Kaye/minesw/infmsw.pdf)
- [Richard Kaye's Minesweeper Pages](http://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/R.W.Kaye/minesw/)
